# Complete User Guide for the Networking Service

Networking is a service that you can use to create virtual networks and attach cloud devices such as servers to these networks.

This user guide will introduce you the entities in the Networking service &mdash; networks, subnets, and ports &mdash; as well as show you how to create and manage these entities.

## Concepts

To use the Networking service effectively, you should understand the following key concepts:

* **Network**: A network is an isolated virtual layer-2 broadcast domain that is typically reserved for the tenant who created it unless you configure the network to be shared. The network is the main entity in the Networking service. Ports and subnets are always associated with a network.

* **Subnet**: A subnet represents an IP address block that can be used to assign IP addresses to virtual instances (such as servers created using the Compute service). Each subnet must have a CIDR and must be associated with a network.

* **Port**: A port represents a virtual switch port on a logical network switch. Virtual instances (such as servers created using the Compute service) attach their interfaces into ports. The port also defines the MAC address and the IP address(es) to be assigned to the interfaces plugged into them. When IP addresses are associated to a port, this also implies the port is associated with a subet, as the IP address is taken from the allocation pool for a specific subnet.

## Prerequisites

### Client
To use the Networking service, you must first instantiate a `OpenStack` or `Rackspace` client object.

* If you are working with an OpenStack cloud, instantiate an `OpenCloud\OpenStack` client as follows:

    ```php
    use OpenCloud\OpenStack;

    $client = new OpenStack('<OPENSTACK CLOUD IDENTITY ENDPOINT URL>', array(
        'username' => '<YOUR OPENSTACK CLOUD ACCOUNT USERNAME>',
        'password' => '<YOUR OPENSTACK CLOUD ACCOUNT PASSWORD>'
    ));
    ```

* If you are working with the Rackspace cloud, instantiate a `OpenCloud\Rackspace` client as follows:

    ```php
    use OpenCloud\Rackspace;

    $client = new Rackspace(Rackspace::US_IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, array(
        'username' => '<YOUR RACKSPACE CLOUD ACCOUNT USERNAME>',
        'apiKey'   => '<YOUR RACKSPACE CLOUD ACCOUNT API KEY>'
    ));
    ```

### Networking service

All Networking operations are done via a _networking service object_. To 
instantiate this object, call the `networkingService` method on the `$client`
object. This method takes two arguments:

| Position | Description | Data type | Required? | Default value | Example value |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  1       | Name of the service, as it appears in the service catalog | String | No | `null`; automatically determined when possible | `cloudNetworks` |
|  2       | Cloud region | String | Yes | - | `DFW` |


```php
$region = '<CLOUD REGION NAME>';
$networkingService = $client->networkingService(null, $region);
```

Any networks, subnets, and ports created with this `$networkingService` instance will
be stored in the cloud region specified by `$region`.

## Networks

A network is an isolated virtual layer-2 broadcast domain that is typically reserved for the tenant who created it unless you configure the network to be shared. The network is the main entity in the Networking service. Ports and subnets are always associated with a network.

### Create a network

This operation takes one parameter, an associative array, with the following keys:

| Name | Description | Data type | Required? | Default value | Example value |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `name` | Human-readable name for the network. Might not be unique. | String | No | `null` | `My private backend network` |
| `adminStateUp` | The administrative state of network. If `false` (down), the network does not forward packets. | Boolean | No | `true` | `true` |
| `shared` | Specifies whether the network resource can be accessed by any tenant or not. | Boolean | No | `false` | `false` |
| `tenantId` | Owner of network. Only admin users can specify a tenant ID other than their own. | String | No | Same as tenant creating the network | `123456` |

You can create a network as shown in the following example:

```php
$network = $networkingService->createNetwork(array(
    'name' => 'My private backend network'
));
/** @var $network OpenCloud\Networking\Resource\Network **/
```

### Create multiple networks

This operation takes one parameter, an indexed array. Each element of this array must
be an associative array with the keys shown in [the table above](#create-a-network).

You can create multiple networks as shown in the following example:

```php
$networks = $networkingService->createNetworks(array(
    array(
        'name' => 'My private backend network #1'
    ),
    array(
        'name' => 'My private backend network #2'
    )
));

foreach ($networks as $network) {
    /** @var $network OpenCloud\Networking\Resource\Network **/
}
```

[ [Get the executable PHP script for this example](/samples/Networking/create-networks.php) ]

$networks = $networkingService->listNetworks();
foreach ($networks as $network) {
    /** @var $network OpenCloud\Networking\Resource\Network **/
}
```

[ [Get the executable PHP script for this example](/samples/Networking/list-networks.php) ]

### Get network

| `adminStateUp` | The administrative state of network. If `false` (down), the network does not forward packets. | Boolean | No | `true` | `true` |
| `shared` | Specifies whether the network resource can be accessed by any tenant or not. | Boolean | No | `false` | `false` |
